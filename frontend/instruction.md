*# Detailed E-commerce Website Plan*

## *Project Overview*
You are tasked with building a complete *dynamic* e-commerce platform with two separate frontend files:

- *Seller Interface (responsive)* for brands and sellers.

The backend will be built using *MongoDB* and will have a well-structured set of API endpoints, ensuring robust functionality. The frontend will be developed using *React.js with Tailwind CSS, and **React Router* for navigation.
